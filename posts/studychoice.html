        <p>I value learning and freedom deeply, so I wanted to choose a study that supports both. ICT feels like the right fit because it combines constant learning with the flexibility to work anywhere in the world. I’m still exploring which specific career path I want to follow, but I hope that will become clearer as I attend lectures, participate in projects, and gain more insight through conferences and internships.

One thing I’m certain about is my desire to go abroad. I’m especially interested in Sweden and Japan — two countries that value innovation and have a strong demand for IT professionals. I have known sweden through family vacations, while my fascination with Japan began through watching youtube videos. especially from Chirs Broas who makes documentaries. I find the history and philosophy of Japan  quite interesting. Both countries inspire me not only professionally but also personally, with their unique balance between nature, technology, and tradition.

What excites me most about ICT is how quickly it evolves.</p>
